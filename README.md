# ABDFMW
Abide Bot Framework built on Discord.js v11

ABDFMW isn't your average modular bot framework. It is very efficient and fast, and light on system resources. And it's a modified version of Komada without some of the gimmicks. (Great framework, no hate.)

> Aren't I nice for including everything you need to get started?

## "Installation" If you can call it that.

There really is no installation. It isnt an NPM module or anything, I'm not fancy.

```
git clone https://github.com/motiond3v/abdfmw.git
```
Once you're done with that, go ahead and open up the included config.json file, and change it as needed.

> Note: The dependencies for this bot are chalk, moment, randomcolor, and obviously discord.js

> Node 6 or higher is required!

Now, you just run 1, simple, command. And it (should) work.
```
node app.js
```

> A guide on making commands compatible with ABDFMW will be soon, so stick around. In the meantime, go ahead and look through the command files and try to figure it out on your own! (if you dare).
